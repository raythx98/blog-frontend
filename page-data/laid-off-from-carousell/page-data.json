The primary objective was to overhaul and modernize the categorization system for product listings. A central challenge was to seamlessly migrate millions of existing listings from their old categories to the newly defined ones, all without causing any significant downtime or disruptions to our platform.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this, we collaborated closely with several key teams, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Team: Working collaboratively with the Data Team, we developed a sophisticated model designed to intelligently match listings from the old categories to their corresponding new categories.</li>\n<li>Country Managers: As part of our global expansion efforts, we collaborated with Country Managers to ensure the integration of new translations for different markets.</li>\n<li>Search Team: The Search Team played a vital role in updating their search indexes to align with the revamped category structure. </li>\n<li>Numerous Other Teams: This project required cooperation and coordination with various other teams, all contributing their unique expertise and efforts to make the Category Revamp project a resounding success.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These projects were not only technically challenging but also demanded effective cross-team collaboration and project management skills. Despite the subsequent layoff, I am proud of the valuable contributions I made to these initiatives during my time at Carousell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"amazing-mentors-and-managers\"><a href=\"#amazing-mentors-and-managers\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Amazing mentors and managers</h3>\n<p>During my tenure at Carousell, I was fortunate to meet my mentor, Ben. Ben had a reputation for being a 10X engineer, consistently tackling the most challenging problems. His work not only inspired me but also motivated me to delve into engineering tooling that significantly boosted the productivity of our fellow engineers.</p>\n<p>In addition to the invaluable mentorship from Ben, I was fortunate to have exceptional engineering managers, Wilson and Isaac. They exhibited a genuine commitment to my learning and career development while prioritizing my well-being to prevent burnout. In the initial stages of my onboarding process, I was intensely focused on advancing my career to the point where I sometimes overlooked self-care.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Work is a marathon, not a sprint.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was one piece of advice given by my manager that will forever resonate with me. This counsel serves as a constant reminder of the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance and pacing oneself for long-term success. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"what-happened\"><a href=\"#what-happened\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What happened?</h3>\n<p>While I cherished my time in my previous working environment, I came to realize that not all good things last forever.
